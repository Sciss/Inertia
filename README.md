# Inertia

## statement

Inertia was a software developed for the audio-visual installation Command Control Communication.
It is an editor as well as player for the "mobile" sound component. It would talk to Max/Jitter
(later Pd/Gem) via OSC to synchronise video clips. Later a stand-alone headless player version
was added using SuperCollider (no GUI).
